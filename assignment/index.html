      <h2>Check the console...</h2>
      <p>
        I was able to console log each star in its array but I guess I was confused
        as to exactly what the prompt is asking for?
      </p>
          <p>
            // 2.a. TODO: Write a for of loop to console.log each star in the 'stars' array
            console.log('Some stars:');
            for( set of stars) {
              console.log('for of loop', stars);
              if( stars == '4');
              console.log(set);
              } // end
          </p>
            <p>
              I was able to exceute this problem. However at first attempts the
              console was stating that 'i' had already been declared, however
              when i was looking over the syntax I didnt see that i had
              declared i. I instead used 'var' for 0, in order to get the line to
              work. Do you see something that i missed? thank you!
            </p>
              <p>
                //3.b. TODO// 3.b. TODO: Write a while loop to console.log the numbers from 0 to 5
                var i = 0;
                const five = 6;
                console.log('Count from 0 to 5');
                while (i < five) {
                  console.log('', (i));
                  i++;
                }
