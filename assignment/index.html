      <h2>Check the console...</h2>
      <p>
        I was able to console log each star in its array but I guess I was confused
        as to exactly what the prompt is asking for?
      </p>
          <p>
            // 2.a. TODO: Write a for of loop to console.log each star in the 'stars' array
            console.log('Some stars:');
            for( set of stars) {
              console.log('for of loop', stars);
              if( stars == '4');
              console.log(set);
              } // end
